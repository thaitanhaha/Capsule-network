# CNN and Capsule with human face

I constructed a dataset of human faces with their eyes and mouth swapped in position. 
Then, I performed the task of classifying the normal human faces and the edited human faces.

## First experiment

I trained both CNN and Capsule with Human Face dataset labeled as 1 and Flower dataset labeled as 0.
Then I tested with Human Face Swapped dataset.

## Second experiment

I train both CNN and Capsule with Human Face dataset labeled as 1 and Human Face Swapped dataset labeled as 0.
Then I tested with Human Face Swapped dataset.

## Conclusion
